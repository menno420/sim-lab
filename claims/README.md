# claims/ — one file per claim

Before working a sim subtree (or any shared surface), create `claims/<branch>.md` —
one bullet: `branch · sim/scope · expected files · date` — and delete it at session
close. One file per claim, never a shared list (superbot Q-0195: per-file ≈ 0% conflict
rate vs ~98% shared-append). Parallel workers claim disjoint sims.

Pre-resolved at seed: kit adoption, `.substrate/`, `control/`, `sims/` + `harness/`
skeletons — seeded in one pass by the dispatch copilot (2026-07-10); no shared-ground
races remain from birth.
